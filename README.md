To run the shape generator:

1. Make sure you have the shape_generator library installed in Blender. 
    there are instructions [here](https://blendermarket.com/products/shape-generator/docs). 
    I can send you the zip file. 
    
2. Run: `Blender -b -P random_shapegen.py path/to/save/directory number_of_shapes(ie; 50000)`

This will generate random shape generator shapes and save out their properties, as well as the blend files
and .obj files.
